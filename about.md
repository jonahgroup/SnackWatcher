**Snack Watcher** project goal is to build a `ChatOps`, which is a latest trend of DevOps Bot
connected to the company's chat channels, assists to perform daily system operations.
Starting as a [Jonah Group](http://www.jonahgroup.com) working group project,
we propose the first useful operation is watching "Snack" on the company's
"Snack Table". If there is some new "Snack" presented on the "Snack Table",
the ChatOps would report the event onto a chat channels, saying "Snack Happened!"
and posting an image of what it observed on the table.
