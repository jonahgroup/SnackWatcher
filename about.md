# About Snack Watcher

Starting as a fun [Jonah Group](http://www.jonahgroup.com) project,
the **Snack Watcher** is designed to watch the company's "Snack Table". If there are
some new "Snacks" presented on the "Snack Table", it can be used to report the
event onto chat channels, emails or messages saying "Snack Happened!", posting
an image and trying to classify the snacks that it observed. It supports both as
web site for interactive snack viewing and RESTful API for programmatic snack querying.

It is open source in hope of advancing the sharing spirit and snacking fun within your company!
